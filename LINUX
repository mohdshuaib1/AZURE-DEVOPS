For AZURE DEVOPS, the first step is to learn about the LINUX commands and their ARCHITECTURE. 
MOST IMPORTANT IS IN LINUX IS 
KERNEL--> The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system
          some key points about it.
          (1)Open Source
          (2)Security
          (3)Multi-User and Multi-Tasking 
          (4)Hardware Support
          (5)File Systems   ETC..

After some brief information about it, I am going to discuss something in COMMANDS and their Syntax,
COMMAND SYNTAX-->
                (1)Command--To perform some actions!
                (2)Option-- To apply filters on the Commands result!
